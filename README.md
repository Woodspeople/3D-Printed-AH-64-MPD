Welcome to the AH-64 Printed MPD project.
-
The goal of this project was to design a hardware setup for the AH-64, allowing users to chose their own electronics to connect it to.

Here is a summary of the files in this repository:

**Arduino IDE sketches (folder)**
This folder contains my Arduino/Teensyduino sketches for USB HID input.

**odt files (folder)**
This folder contains the original source files for the PDFs in the repository.
The un-compressed images make these files very large.
(Download the release version without these instead to avoid wasting space and time.)

**Stls (folder)**
This folder contains binary .stl files for all the required 3D printed parts.

**ah-64_electronics_guide.pdf**
This brief guide summarizes my electronics setups.

**ah-64_mpd_BoM.pdf**
This document contains a full list of materials required to complete the frame.

**ah-64_mpd_build_guide_pictures_rc1.pdf**
This guide contains a full set of step by step instructions to build the frame.

**ah-64d mpd v15.f3z**
This is an export of the latest version (at time of writing) of the cad files.

**ah-64d mpd v15.step**
Alternate export for any programs that might not support .f3z files.

Check out the build guide or Bill of materials for more information.

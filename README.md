The goal of this project was to design a hardware setup for the AH-64, allowing users to chose their own electronics to connect it to.

Here is a summary of the files in this repository:

**Arduino_IDE_sketches (folder)**  
This folder contains my Arduino/Teensyduino sketches for USB HID input.

**odt_files (folder)**  
This folder contains the original source files for the PDFs in the repository.
The .odt file for the build guide is quite large (135MB) so these files are stored with Git Large File Storage. If you want to download them you can do so by previewing them in the repository and clicking download there.

**Stls (folder)**  
This folder contains binary .stl files for all the required 3D printed parts.

**ah-64_electronics_guide.pdf**  
This brief guide summarizes my electronics setups.

**ah-64_mpd_BoM.pdf**  
This document contains a full list of materials required to complete the frame.

**ah-64_mpd_build_guide_pictures_rc1.pdf**  
This guide contains a full set of step by step instructions to build the frame.

**ah-64d mpd v15.f3z**  
This is an export of the latest version (at time of writing) of the cad files.

**ah-64d mpd v15.step**  
Alternate export for any programs that might not support .f3z files.

Check out the build guide or Bill of materials for more information.
